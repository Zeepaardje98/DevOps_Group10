# DevOps_Group10: Migrate a classical application to the cloud

## Description
A university wants to migrate its attendance system to the cloud. The
solution should require minimal maintenance for the engineers who
manage the AWS cloud environment as they already have a staff
shortage. One of the engineers suggested a serverless solution to
reduce infrastructure maintenance to limit additional work on
infrastructure for the IT department.

## Requirements
* An attendance registration system prototype with back and front-end
* Scalability to handle peak traffic
* Automated deployment of back and front-end
* All code must be void of plaintext secrets

## Expected Output
* Design of the created solution.
* Working attendance registration system.
* A system that scales out during peak traffic.
* A solution deployed via DevOps best practices
  * Documentation is generated
  * Deployed via pipeline(s)
  * Secret management is applied
